# IMDB Sentiment Classifier

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for a sentiment classification model trained on the IMDB dataset.

## Contents

1. `sentiment_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code implementation of the sentiment classifier.
2. `sentiment_analysis_paper.pdf`: Detailed paper describing the methodology, results, and analysis.

## Overview

This project focuses on building a text classifier for sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. The classifier was trained on the first 40,000 instances and tested on the last 10,000 instances of the dataset.

For a comprehensive understanding of the project, including methodology, model architecture, training process, results, and analysis, please refer to the `sentiment_analysis_paper.pdf` in this repository.

## Dataset

The IMDB dataset used in this project was provided in the repository.

## Running the Code

To run the classifier:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (list them if not included in the notebook).
2. Open the `sentiment_classifier.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code.
